## Requirements
Before install be sure to have installed and in your `PATH`
[FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) and [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/)

* For Ubuntu/Debian use:

### Windows
Install ImageMagick from [here](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/binary-releases.php#windows), it already has ffmpeg.

**This package has not support for OS X** (I don't have a mac to test it).

But PR are welcome :smile:
